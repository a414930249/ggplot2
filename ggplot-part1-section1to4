Introduction

The R package "ggplot2" is a free Visualization package for the R statistical analysis platform, loosely based on "The Grammar of Graphics" from Leland Wilkinson.

ggplot2 is an intuitive library that is founded on a logical mapping between data and graphical elements

The package follows the ideas proposed by Grammar of Graphics an influential text in data visualization.

Lattice base package in most R installations
advanced data visualization capability
aesthetically pleasing professional quality.
publication quality graphics.

Grid graphics is a third graphics package, developed by NZ statistician, Paul Murrell. Ggplot and Lattice are based on Grid Graphics.

Ggplot can be thought of as a programming language, designed to produce publication ready graphics.



Basic Functions

Installing and using the ggplot2 package


install.packages("ggplot2") 

# Choose "Ireland" as your mirror

library(ggplot2)

The Diamonds Data set

This dataset contains approximately 50,000 items. 
Each row is an individual diamond, and some of the variables of interest include the weight of the diamond in carats, color, clarity, and its price.


data(diamonds)

The qplot() command

Using base R graphics there are different commands for scatterplots and histograms. 
But in ggplot2, if you specify a single continuous variable to the qplot() command, you'll get a histogram. 
If you specify two continuous variables to the same qplot() command, you get a scatterplot. 


Basic Histogram

Using base graphics: 
 
with(diamonds, hist(price))


using GGPLOT2

qplot(price, data=diamonds, binwidth=1000) 


Adding Titles and Labels

to add labels and a main title to your plot using xlab, ylab, and main.  
If you know how to do this using base graphics, then you already know how to do this using ggplot2.

Using base graphics:
with(diamonds, plot(carat,price, xlab="Weight in Carats", ylab="Price in USD", main="Diamonds are expensive!"))


And using ggplot2:
qplot(carat, price, data=diamonds, xlab="Weight in Carats", ylab="Price in USD", main="Diamonds are expensive!")


Facets


qplot(carat, price, data=diamonds, facets=color~.)

qplot(carat, price, data=diamonds, facets=clarity~color)




Scatterplot matrices in R

A useful function in R to produce a scatterplot matrix of selected variables in a dataset. 
The base graphics function is pairs(). 

Producing these plots can be helpful in exploring your data, especially using the second method below.

Try it out on the built in iris dataset. 

The Iris data set gives the measurements in centimetres of the variables sepal length and width 
and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. 

The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

# Load the iris dataset.
data(iris)
 
#  Basic scatterplot matrix of the four measurements
pairs(~Sepal.Length+Sepal.Width+Petal.Length+Petal.Width, data=iris)


Similar plot using ggplot2, with the diagonal showing the kernel density.


# Plot using ggplot2 

plotmatrix(with(iris, data.frame(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width)))

The GGally package 
The GGally package extends ggplot2 for plot matrices.
