3.6 Data Structures


Learning outcomes of this chapter


3.1 Layered grammar of graphics

Iteratively update plots
encourage/conduce to customized graphics

3.3. Geoms

These are points Lines and bars
Geoms determine the type of plot
scaling: Aesthetics to be scales (X position, Y position, colour)

3.5 Components 
1. Layers
2. Scales
3. Coordinate system
4. Faceting

A plot object is a list with components: data, mapping, layers, scales.


3.5 Components of the layered grammar
Plot generation process
1) map variables
2) facet datasets
3) transform scales
4) compute aesthetics
5) train scales
6) map scales
7) render geoms

3.5.4 Faceting
Faceting is a general case of the conditioned or trellis plots, that make it easy to create small multiples each showing a different subset of the whole data set,
This is a powerful tool when analysing whether patterns are consistent across factors.

3.6 Data Structures

Plot object: list of components (data, mapping, layers,scales,co-ordinates, facets and options)
Plots constructed in two ways: qplot() and ggplot()

Once you have a plot object
Render the object on screen using the print() function
Save the object to disk, using the ggsave() command
Describe the structure with summary().

p <- qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, colour=factor(cyl))
summary(p)
